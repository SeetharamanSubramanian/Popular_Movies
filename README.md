This project is part of my Android Development Nanodegree course from Udacity.

An API key is required for the proper functioning of the app, which can be obtained from:
https://www.themoviedb.org/account/signup

Create a free account and request for an API by filling in some basic information. 

Once an API key has been obtained, it is to be substituted in the **gradle.properties** file *within* the parantheses.
